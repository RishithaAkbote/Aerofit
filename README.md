# Aerofit - Descriptive Statistics & Probability 
This project focuses on analyzing the Aerofit dataset to derive actionable insights using descriptive statistics and probability. The analysis, conducted in Jupyter Notebook, explores various factors affecting customer behavior and product recommendations. The final output, including code and results, is available in a PDF exported from the notebook.

**Project Overview**
The objective of this project is to leverage descriptive statistics and probability concepts to uncover patterns in the dataset and provide strategic recommendations. The analysis covers:

**EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: Understanding the dataset through summary statistics and visualization.
**Graphical Representation**: Visualizing null values and distributions.
**Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis:** Examining individual variables and their relationships.
**Actionable Insights and Recommendations:** Translating findings into business strategies.

**Key Highlights**

**1. Data Cleaning and Exploration**
* Visualized null values and distribution of data to identify missing or unevenly distributed values.
* Analyzed the count values in columns to understand dataset composition.

**2. Statistical Analysis**
**Univariate Analysis:** Examined individual variables using box plots to detect outliers and distribution patterns.
**Bivariate Analysis:**
* Studied the effect of features like gender and marital status on product preferences.
* Explored income group tendencies in purchasing Aerofit products.

**Multivariate Analysis:**
* Combined multiple variables to generate deeper insights into purchasing behavior.

**3. Visual Insights**
* Utilized advanced visualizations, including:
* Box plots for outlier detection.
* Combined graphs to reveal correlations between factors.

**4. Actionable Insights and Recommendations**
**Product Preferences by Gender:**
* The KP281 treadmill is the most popular product for both genders, driven by its cost-effectiveness. Marketing strategies should emphasize its value while positioning KP481 and KP781 as premium options.
**Age-Based Trends:**
* Customers aged 20-30 prefer affordable models like KP281, while those aged 30-40 value advanced features, making them ideal candidates for premium upselling.
Older adults (40+) lean toward KP781 and KP281, suggesting opportunities for tailored designs and targeted promotions to engage this segment.
**Impact of Marital Status:**
* Non-single customers are more likely to purchase fitness equipment. Introducing discount coupons or EMI options could drive sales among single customers.
**Educational Insights:**
* Customers with 20+ years of education favor premium models like KP781, whereas less experienced customers tend to purchase KP281 and KP481.
**Purchase Probabilities:**
Male customers represent 58% of buyers, with a 32% probability of selecting the KP781 treadmill.

**Tools and Technologies Used**

**Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive coding and analysis.

**Python Libraries:**
* pandas for data manipulation.
* matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
